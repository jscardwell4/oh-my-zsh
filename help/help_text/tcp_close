tcp_close [-qn] [ -a | -l sess,... | sess ... ]
       Close the named sessions, or the  current  session  if  none  is
       given,  or all open sessions if -a is given.  The options -l and
       -s are both handled for consistency with tcp_open, although  the
       latter is redundant.

       If  the  session  being  closed is the current one, $TCP_SESS is
       unset, leaving no current session, even if there are other  ses-
       sions still open.

       If  the session was opened with tcp_open -f, the file descriptor
       is closed so long as it is  in  the  range  0  to  9  accessible
       directly  from  the command line.  If the option -n is given, no
       attempt will be made to close file  descriptors  in  this  case.
       The  -n  option  is  not used for genuine ztcp session; the file
       descriptors are always closed with the session.

       If the option -q is given, no  informational  messages  will  be
       printed.
