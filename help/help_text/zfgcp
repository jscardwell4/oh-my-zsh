zfgcp [ -Gt ] remote-file local-file
zfgcp [ -Gt ] rfile1 ... ldir
       This retrieves files  from  the  remote  server  with  arguments
       behaving similarly to the cp command.

       In the first form, copy remote-file from the server to the local
       file local-file.

       In the second form, copy all the remote files  rfile1  ...  into
       the  local  directory  ldir  retaining the same basenames.  This
       assumes UNIX directory semantics.
