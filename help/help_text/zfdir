zfdir [ -rfd ] [ - ] [ dir-options ] [ dir ]
       Produce a long directory listing.  The arguments dir-options and
       dir are passed directly to the server and their effect is imple-
       mentation dependent, but specifying a particular  remote  direc-
       tory  dir  is  usually possible.  The output is passed through a
       pager given by the environment variable  $PAGER,  or  `more'  if
       that is not set.

       The directory is usually cached for re-use.  In fact, two caches
       are maintained.  One is for use when there is no dir-options  or
       dir,  i.e. a full listing of the current remote directory; it is
       flushed when the current remote directory changes.  The other is
       kept  for  repeated  use  of  zfdir with the same arguments; for
       example, repeated use of `zfdir /pub/gnu' will only require  the
       directory  to  be  retrieved  on the first call.  Alternatively,
       this cache can be re-viewed with the  -r  option.   As  relative
       directories  will  confuse  zfdir,  the -f option can be used to
       force the cache to be flushed before the  directory  is  listed.
       The  option  -d will delete both caches without showing a direc-
       tory listing; it will also delete the cache of file names in the
       current remote directory, if any.
