tcp_fd_handler
       This  is  the  function installed by tcp_open for handling input
       from within the line editor, if that is required.  It is in  the
       format documented for the builtin `zle -F' in zshzle(1) .

       While active, the function sets the parameter TCP_HANDLER_ACTIVE
       to 1.  This allows shell code called internally (for example, by
       setting  tcp_on_read)  to tell if is being called when the shell
       is otherwise idle at the editor prompt.
