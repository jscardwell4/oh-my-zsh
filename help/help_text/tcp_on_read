tcp_on_read
       This should be an associative array; if it is not, the behaviour
       is undefined.  Each key is the name of a shell function or other
       command, and the corresponding value is a shell  pattern  (using
       EXTENDED_GLOB).   Every line read from a TCP session directly or
       indirectly  using  tcp_read  (which  includes  lines   read   by
       tcp_expect)  is  compared  against  the  pattern.   If  the line
       matches, the command given in the key is called with  two  argu-
       ments: the name of the session from which the line was read, and
       the line itself.

       If any function called to handle a line returns a non-zero  sta-
       tus,  the  line  is not output.  Thus a tcp_on_read handler con-
       taining only the instruction `return 1' can be used to  suppress
       output  of  particular  lines  (see, however, tcp_filter above).
       However, the line is still stored  in  TCP_LINE  and  tcp_lines;
       this occurs after all tcp_on_read processing.
