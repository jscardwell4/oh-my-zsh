tcp_send [-cnq] [ -s sess | -l sess,... ] data ...
tcp_send [-cnq] -a data ...
       Send the supplied data strings to all the specified sessions  in
       turn.  The underlying operation differs little from a `print -r'
       to the session's file descriptor, although it attempts  to  pre-
       vent  the  shell  from  dying  owing  to  a SIGPIPE caused by an
       attempt to write to a defunct session.

       The option -c causes tcp_send to  behave  like  cat.   It  reads
       lines  from  standard input until end of input and sends them in
       turn to the specified session(s) exactly as if they  were  given
       as data arguments to individual tcp_send commands.

       The  option  -n  prevents tcp_send from putting a newline at the
       end of the data strings.

       The remaining options all behave as for tcp_read.

       The data arguments are not further processed once they have been
       passed to tcp_send; they are simply passed down to print -r.

       If  the  parameter $TCP_OUTPUT is a non-empty string and logging
       is enabled then the data sent to each session will be echoed  to
       the  log  file(s)  with  $TCP_OUTPUT in front where appropriate,
       much in the manner of $TCP_PROMPT.
