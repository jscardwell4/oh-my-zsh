tcp_command send-options ... send-arguments ...
       This is a convenient front-end to tcp_send.  All  arguments  are
       passed  to  tcp_send, then the function pauses waiting for data.
       While data is arriving at least every $TCP_TIMEOUT (default 0.3)
       seconds,  data  is handled and printed out according to the cur-
       rent settings.  Status 0 is always returned.

       This is generally only useful for interactive  use,  to  prevent
       the display becoming fragmented by output returned from the con-
       nection.  Within a programme or function it is generally  better
       to handle reading data by a more explicit method.
