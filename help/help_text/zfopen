zfopen [ -1 ] [ host [ user [ password [ account ] ] ] ]
       If  host  is present, open a connection to that host under user-
       name user with password password (and,  on  the  rare  occasions
       when  it is necessary, account account).  If a necessary parame-
       ter is missing or given as `?' it will be prompted for.  If host
       is not present, use a previously stored set of parameters.

       If  the  command  was successful, and the terminal is compatible
       with xterm or is sun-cmd, a summary will  appear  in  the  title
       bar,  giving the local host:directory and the remote host:direc-
       tory; this is handled  by  the  function  zftp chpwd,  described
       below.

       Normally,  the  host,  user and password are internally recorded
       for later re-opening, either by a zfopen with no  arguments,  or
       automatically (see below).  With the option `-1', no information
       is stored.  Also, if an open command with arguments failed,  the
       parameters  will  not  be  retained (and any previous parameters
       will also be deleted).  A zfopen on its own,  or  a  zfopen  -1,
       never alters the stored parameters.

       Both zfopen and zfanon (but not zfparams) understand URLs of the
       form ftp://host/path... as meaning to connect to the host,  then
       change  directory  to  path  (which  must  be a directory, not a
       file).  The `ftp://' can be omitted; the trailing `/' is  enough
       to  trigger  recognition  of the path.  Note prefixes other than
       `ftp:' are not recognized, and that  all  characters  after  the
       first slash beyond host are significant in path.
