tcp_wait
       The sole argument is an integer or floating point  number  which
       gives  the seconds to delay.  The shell will do nothing for that
       period except wait for input on  all  TCP  sessions  by  calling
       tcp_read  -a.   This  is similar to the interactive behaviour at
       the command prompt when zle handlers are installed.
