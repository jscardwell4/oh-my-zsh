zfuget [ -Gvst ] file1 ...
       As zfget, but only retrieve  files  where  the  version  on  the
       remote server is newer (has a later modification time), or where
       the local file does not exist.  If the remote file is older  but
       the files have different sizes, or if the sizes are the same but
       the remote file is newer, the  user  will  usually  be  queried.
       With  the  option  -s, the command runs silently and will always
       retrieve the file in either of those two cases.  With the option
       -v, the command prints more information about the files while it
       is working out whether or not to transfer them.
