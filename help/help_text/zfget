zfget match prefix suffix
       This performs matching for completion of remote  filenames.   It
       caches  files  for  the  current  directory  (only) in the shell
       parameter $zftp fcache.  It is in the form to be called  by  the
       -K  option  of  compctl,  but also works when called from a wid-
       get-style completion function with prefix and suffix set  appro-
       priately.
