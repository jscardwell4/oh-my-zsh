TCP_LOG
       May be set directly, although it is also controlled by  tcp_log.
       The  name  of  a  file to which output from all sessions will be
       sent.  The output is proceeded by the usual $TCP_PROMPT.  If  it
       is  not an absolute path name, it will follow the user's current
       directory.
