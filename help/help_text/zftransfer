zftransfer sess1:file1 sess2:file2
       Transfer files between two sessions; no local copy is made.  The
       file is read from the session sess1 as file1 and written to ses-
       sion sess2 as file file2; file1 and file2 may be relative to the
       current directories of the session.  Either sess1 or  sess2  may
       be  omitted  (though  the colon should be retained if there is a
       possibility of a colon appearing in the file name) and  defaults
       to  the  current session; file2 may be omitted or may end with a
       slash, in which case the basename of file1 will be  added.   The
       sessions sess1 and sess2 must be distinct.

       The  operation  is performed using pipes, so it is required that
       the connections still be valid in a subshell, which is  not  the
       case under versions of some operating systems, presumably due to
       a system bug.
