       Open  a connection host for anonymous FTP.  The username used is
       `anonymous'.  The password (which will  be  reported  the  first
       time)  is  generated  as  user@host;  this is then stored in the
       shell parameter $EMAIL ADDR which can alternatively be set manu-
       ally to a suitable string.
