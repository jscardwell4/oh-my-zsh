zfsession [ -lvod ] [ sessname ]
       Allows you to manage multiple FTP sessions at once.  By default,
       connections  take place in a session called `default'; by giving
       the command `zfsession sessname' you can  change  to  a  new  or
       existing  session  with  a name of your choice.  The new session
       remembers its own connection, as well as associated shell param-
       eters, and also the host/user parameters set by zfparams.  Hence
       you can have different sessions set up to connect  to  different
       hosts, each remembering the appropriate host, user and password.

       With no arguments, zfsession prints the name of the current ses-
       sion;  with  the option -l it lists all sessions which currently
       exist, and with the option -v it gives a  verbose  list  showing
       the  host and directory for each session, where the current ses-
       sion is marked with an asterisk.  With -o, it will switch to the
       most recent previous session.

       With -d, the given session (or else the current one) is removed;
       everything to do with it is completely forgotten.  If it was the
       only session, a new session called `default' is created and made
       current.  It is safest not to delete sessions  while  background
       commands using zftp are active.
