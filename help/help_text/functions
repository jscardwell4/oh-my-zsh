functions [ {+|-}UXkmtTuz ] [ name ... ]
                              ----
functions -M mathfn [ min [ max [ shellfn ] ] ]
             ------   ---   ---   -------
functions -M [ -m pattern ... ]
                  -------
functions +M [ -m ] mathfn
                    ------
       Equivalent to typeset -f, with the exception of the  -M  option.
       Use of the -M option may not be combined with any of the options
       handled by typeset -f.

       functions -M mathfn defines mathfn as the name of a mathematical
                    ------         ------
       function  recognised  in  all forms of arithmetical expressions;
       see the  section  `Arithmetic  Evaluation'  in  zshmisc(1).   By
                                                       -------
       default mathfn may take any number of comma-separated arguments.
               ------
       If min is given, it must have exactly min args; if min  and  max
          ---                                ---          ---       ---
       are  both given, it must have at least min and at most max args.
                                              ---             ---
       max may be -1 to indicate that there is no upper limit.
       ---

       By default the function is implemented by a  shell  function  of
       the  same name; if shellfn is specified it gives the name of the
                          -------
       corresponding shell function while mathfn remains the name  used
                                          ------
       in  arithmetical expressions.  The name of the function in $0 is
       mathfn (not shellfn as would usually be the case), provided  the
       ------      -------
       option FUNCTION ARGZERO is in effect.  The positional parameters
                      -
       in the shell function correspond to the arguments of the  mathe-
       matical  function  call.   The  result  of the last arithmetical
       expression evaluated inside the shell function (even if it is  a
       form  that  normally  only returns a status) gives the result of
       the mathematical function.

       functions -M with no arguments lists all such user-defined func-
       tions  in  the  same  form as a definition.  With the additional
       option -m and a list of arguments, all  functions  whose  mathfn
                                                                 ------
       matches one of the pattern arguments are listed.

       function +M removes the list of mathematical functions; with the
       additional option -m the arguments are treated as  patterns  and
       all  functions  whose  mathfn  matches  the pattern are removed.
       Note that the shell function implementing the behaviour  is  not
       removed  (regardless of whether its name coincides with mathfn).

       For example, the following prints the cube of 3:

              zmath cube() { (( $1 * $1 * $1 )) }
                   -
              functions -M cube 1 1 zmath cube
                                         -
              print $(( cube(3) ))
