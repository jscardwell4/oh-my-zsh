tcp_on_open sess fd
       This is called after a new session has  been  defined  with  the
       session  name and file descriptor as arguments.  If it returns a
       non-zero status, opening the session is assumed to fail and  the
       session  is  closed  again;  however,  tcp_open will continue to
       attempt to open any remaining  sessions  given  on  the  command
       line.
