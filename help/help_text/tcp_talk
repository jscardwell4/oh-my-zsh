tcp_talk
       This  is  a  fairly  simple-minded attempt to force input to the
       line editor to go straight to the default TCP_SESSION.

       An escape string, $TCP_TALK_ESCAPE,  default  `:',  is  used  to
       allow  access to normal shell operation.  If it is on its own at
       the start of the line, or followed only by whitespace, the  line
       editor  returns  to normal operation.  Otherwise, the string and
       any following whitespace are skipped and the  remainder  of  the
       line executed as shell input without any change of the line edi-
       tor's operating mode.

       The current implementation is somewhat deficient in terms of use
       of the command history.  For this reason, many users will prefer
       to use some form of alternative approach for sending data easily
       to  the  current  session.  One simple approach is to alias some
       special character (such as `%') to `tcp_command --'.
