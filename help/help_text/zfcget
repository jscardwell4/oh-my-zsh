zfcget [ -Gt ] file1 ...
       As zfget, but if any of the local files exists, and  is  shorter
       than  the corresponding remote file, the command assumes that it
       is the result of a partially completed transfer and attempts  to
       transfer the rest of the file.  This is useful on a poor connec-
       tion which keeps failing.

       Note that this requires a commonly  implemented,  but  non-stan-
       dard,  version of the FTP protocol, so is not guaranteed to work
       on all servers.
