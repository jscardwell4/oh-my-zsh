TCP_SECONDS_START
       This value is created and initialised to zero by tcp_open.

       The functions tcp_read and tcp_expect use  the  shell's  SECONDS
       parameter  for  their own timing purposes.  If that parameter is
       not of floating point type on entry to one of the functions,  it
       will  create  a  local parameter SECONDS which is floating point
       and set the parameter TCP_SECONDS_START to the previous value of
       $SECONDS.   If  the  parameter  is already floating point, it is
       used without a local copy being created and TCP_SECONDS_START is
       not set.  As the global value is zero, the shell elapsed time is
       guaranteed to be the sum of $SECONDS and $TCP_SECONDS_START.

       This can be avoided by setting SECONDS globally  to  a  floating
       point  value  using `typeset -F SECONDS'; then the TCP functions
       will never make a local copy and never set TCP_SECONDS_START  to
       a non-zero value.
