zfpcp local-file remote-file
zfpcp lfile1 ... rdir
       This  sends  files  to the remote server with arguments behaving
       similarly to the cp command.

       With  two  arguments,  copy  local-file   to   the   server   as
       remote-file.

       With  more  than  two arguments, copy all the local files lfile1
       ... into the existing remote directory rdir retaining  the  same
       basenames.  This assumes UNIX directory semantics.

       A  problem  arises if you attempt to use zfpcp lfile1 rdir, i.e.
       the second form of copying but with two arguments, as  the  com-
       mand  has  no  simple  way  of  knowing if rdir corresponds to a
       directory or a filename.  It attempts to resolve this in various
       ways.   First,  if the rdir argument is `.' or `..' or ends in a
       slash, it is assumed to be a directory.  Secondly, if the opera-
       tion  of  copying to a remote file in the first form failed, and
       the remote server sends back the expected failure code 553 and a
       reply  including  the  string  `Is a directory', then zfpcp will
       retry using the second form.
