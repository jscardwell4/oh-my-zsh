zfgoto [ -n ] bookmark
       Return  to  the location given by bookmark, as previously set by
       zfmark.  If the location has user `ftp' or `anonymous', open the
       connection with zfanon, so that no password is required.  If the
       user and host parameters match those stored for the current ses-
       sion,  if  any,  those  will  be  used, and again no password is
       required.  Otherwise a password will be prompted for.

       With the option -n, the bookmark  is  taken  to  be  a  nickname
       stored  by  the  ncftp  program  in  its bookmark file, which is
       assumed to be ~/.ncftp/bookmarks.  The  function  works  identi-
       cally in other ways.  Note that there is no mechanism for adding
       or modifying ncftp bookmarks from the zftp functions.
