zfautocheck [ -dn ]
       This function is called to implement automatic reopening  behav-
       iour,  as  described  in  more  detail  below.  The options must
       appear in the first  argument;  -n  prevents  the  command  from
       changing to the old directory, while -d prevents it from setting
       the variable do close, which it otherwise does  as  a  flag  for
       automatically closing the connection after a transfer.  The host
       and directory for the last session are stored  in  the  variable
       $zflastsession,  but  the internal host/user/password parameters
       must also be correctly set.
