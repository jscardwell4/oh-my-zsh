tcp_spam [-ertv] [ -a | -s  sess | -l sess,... ] cmd ...
       Execute `cmd ...' for each session in turn.  Note this  executes
       the  command and arguments; it does not send the command line as
       data unless the -t (transmit) option is given.

       The sessions may be selected explicitly with the standard -a, -s
       or  -l  options,  or  may  be chosen implicitly.  If none of the
       three options is given  the  rules  are:  first,  if  the  array
       $tcp_spam_list  is  set,  this is taken as the list of sessions,
       otherwise all sessions are taken.  Second, any sessions given in
       the  array  $tcp_no_spam_list  are removed from the list of ses-
       sions.

       Normally, any sessions added by the `-a' flag or when  all  ses-
       sions  are  chosen  implicitly  are spammed in alphabetic order;
       sessions given by the $tcp_spam_list array  or  on  the  command
       line  are  spammed in the order given.  The -r flag reverses the
       order however it was arrived it.

       The -v flag specifies that a $TCP_PROMPT will be  output  before
       each session.  This is output after any modification to TCP_SESS
       by  the  user-defined  tcp_on_spam  function  described   below.
       (Obviously that function is able to generate its own output.)

       If  the  option -e is present, the line given as cmd ... is exe-
       cuted using eval, otherwise it is executed without  any  further
       processing.
