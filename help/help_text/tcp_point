tcp_point port
tcp_shoot host port
       This pair of functions provide a simple way to transfer  a  file
       between  two  hosts  within the shell.  Note, however, that bulk
       data transfer is currently done using cat.  tcp_point reads  any
       data arriving at port and sends it to standard output; tcp_shoot
       connects to port on host and  sends  its  standard  input.   Any
       unused  port  may  be used; the standard mechanism for picking a
       port is to think of a random four-digit number above 1024  until
       one works.

       To  transfer  a  file  from  host  woodcock to host springes, on
       springes:

              tcp_point 8091 >output_file

       and on woodcock:

              tcp_shoot springes 8091 <input_file

       As these two functions do not require tcp_open to set up  a  TCP
       connection first, they may need to be autoloaded separately.
