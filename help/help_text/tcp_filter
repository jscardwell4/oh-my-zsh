tcp_filter
       Array. May be set directly.  A set of extended globbing patterns
       which, if matched in tcp_output, will cause the line not  to  be
       printed  to  standard output.  The patterns should be defined as
       described for the arguments to tcp_expect.  Output  of  line  to
       log files is not affected.
