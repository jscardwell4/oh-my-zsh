zfcd match prefix suffix
       This performs matching for completion of remote directory names.
       If  the  remote  server is UNIX, it will attempt to persuade the
       server to list the remote directory with subdirectories  marked,
       which  usually  works  but is not guaranteed.  On other hosts it
       simply calls zfget match and hence completes all files, not just
       directories.   On  some  systems,  directories may not even look
       like filenames.
