tcp_on_awol sess fd
       If the function tcp_fd_handler is handling input from  the  line
       editor  and  detects that the file descriptor is no longer reus-
       able, by default it removes it from the list of file descriptors
       handled  by  this  method and prints a message.  If the function
       tcp_on_awol is defined it  is  called  immediately  before  this
       point.   It may return status 100, which indicates that the nor-
       mal handling should still be performed; any other return  status
       indicates  that  no  further  action  should  be  taken  and the
       tcp_fd_handler should return immediately with the given  status.
       Typically  the  action  of tcp_on_awol will be to close the ses-
       sion.

       The variable TCP_INVALIDATE_ZLE will be a non-empty string if it
       is  necessary  to  invalidate the line editor display using `zle
       -I' before printing output from the function.

       (`AWOL' is military jargon for `absent without  leave'  or  some
       variation.   It  has  no pre-existing technical meaning known to
       the author.)
