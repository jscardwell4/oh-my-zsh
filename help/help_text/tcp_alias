tcp_alias [-q] alias=sess ...
tcp_alias [-q] [ alias ] ...
tcp_alias -d [-q] alias ...
       This function is not particularly well tested.

       The first form creates an alias for a session  name;  alias  can
       then  be  used  to  refer to the existing session sess.  As many
       aliases may be listed as required.

       The second form lists any aliases specified, or all  aliases  if
       none.

       The  third  form deletes all the aliases listed.  The underlying
       sessions are not affected.

       The option -q suppresses  an  inconsistently  chosen  subset  of
       error messages.
