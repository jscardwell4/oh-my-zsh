zfrtime lfile rfile [ time ]
       Set the local file lfile to have the same modification  time  as
       the  remote  file rfile, or the explicit time time in FTP format
       CCYYMMDDhhmmSS for the GMT  timezone.   This  uses  the  shell's
       zsh/datetime  module to perform the conversion from GMT to local
       time.
