zfput [ -r ] file1 ...
       Send all the file1 ... given separately to  the  remote  server.
       If  a filename contains a `/', the full filename is used locally
       to find the file, but only the basename is used for  the  remote
       file name.

       With the option -r, if any of the files are directories they are
       sent recursively with all their subdirectories, including  files
       beginning  with  `.'.   This  requires  that  the remote machine
       understand UNIX file semantics, since `/' is used as a directory
       separator.
