  [ -t tty ] name
       The value of the parameter name is loaded into the edit  buffer,
       and  the line editor is invoked.  When the editor exits, name is
       set to the string value returned by the  editor.   When  the  -c
       flag  is  given,  the parameter is created if it doesn't already
       exist.  The -a flag may be given with  -c  to  create  an  array
       parameter,  or  the  -A flag to create an associative array.  If
       the type of an existing parameter does not match the type to  be
       created, the parameter is unset and recreated.

       If an array or array slice is being edited, separator characters
       as defined in $IFS will be shown quoted  with  a  backslash,  as
       will  backslashes  themselves.  Conversely, when the edited text
       is split into an array, a backslash quotes an  immediately  fol-
       lowing  separator  character or backslash; no other special han-
       dling of backslashes, or any handling of quotes, is performed.

       Individual elements  of  existing  array  or  associative  array
       parameters may be edited by using subscript syntax on name.  New
       elements are created automatically, even without -c.

       If the -p flag is given, the following string will be  taken  as
       the prompt to display at the left.  If the -r flag is given, the
       following string gives the prompt to display at the  right.   If
       the  -h flag is specified, the history can be accessed from ZLE.
       If the -e flag is given, typing ^D (Control-D) on an empty  line
       causes vared to exit immediately with a non-zero return value.

       The  -M  option gives a keymap to link to the main keymap during
       editing, and the -m option gives a keymap to link to  the  vicmd
       keymap during editing.  For vi-style editing, this allows a pair
       of keymaps to override viins and vicmd.  For  emacs-style  edit-
       ing,  only  -M is normally needed but the -m option may still be
       used.  On exit, the previous keymaps will be restored.

       Vared calls  the  usual  `zle-line-init'  and  `zle-line-finish'
       hooks  before  and  after  it takes control. Using the -i and -f
       options, it is possible to replace these with other custom  wid-
       gets.

       If `-t tty' is given, tty is the name of a terminal device to be
       used instead of the default /dev/tty.  If tty does not refer  to
       a terminal an error is reported.
