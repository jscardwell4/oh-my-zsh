zfmark [ bookmark ]
       If  given an argument, mark the current host, user and directory
       under the name bookmark for later use by zfgoto.  If there is no
       connection  open, use the values for the last connection immedi-
       ately before it was closed; it is an error if  there  was  none.
       Any  existing  bookmark  under  the  same  name will be silently
       replaced.

       If not given an argument, list the existing  bookmarks  and  the
       points to which they refer in the form user@host:directory; this
       is the format in which they are stored,  and  the  file  may  be
       edited directly.
